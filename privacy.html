  <h1>Privacy Policy for QuipIn</h1>
  <p>QuipIn is a browser extension that helps users generate smart and concise replies or summaries for content on supported platforms like LinkedIn and Reddit using AI services such as OpenAI and Google Gemini.</p>

  <h2>What We Collect</h2>
  <p><strong>We do not collect, log, or transmit any personal or usage data.</strong> All processing happens on your device.</p>

  <h2>Use of Local Storage</h2>
  <p>The extension uses Chrome’s local storage to securely store your API key for OpenAI or Google Gemini. This key is used solely to send requests to the selected AI provider and is never transmitted elsewhere.</p>

  <h2>Use of Permissions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Used to save your API key and model preference locally.</li>
    <li><strong>Tabs:</strong> Used to detect the currently active tab and show relevant settings per supported website (LinkedIn or Reddit).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How Data Is Used</h2>
  <p>When you click to generate a suggestion or summary, only the content of the active post is sent directly to OpenAI or Google’s API for processing. We do not intercept or store any user interaction or content beyond that.</p>

  <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not share, store, or transmit any data to our servers. All interactions occur directly between your browser and the selected AI provider.</p>

  <h2>Security and Control</h2>
  <p>You have full control over your data. You can add, change, or remove your API key at any time from the extension settings. Your data stays within your browser environment.</p>

  <h2>Supported Platforms</h2>
  <p>Currently, QuipIn supports LinkedIn and Reddit. More platforms may be added in the future with similar privacy guarantees.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>For questions, feedback, or support, contact us at <a href="mailto:kishansuvarna@gmail.com">kishansuvarna@gmail.com</a>.</p>
